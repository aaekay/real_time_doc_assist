    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "They come out of nowhere. My heart starts pounding really fast, I get this tightness in my chest, and I feel like I can't breathe. My hands go numb and tingly, I start sweating, and I feel like I'm going to die or go crazy. They last about 10 to 20 minutes. I've been having them two to three times a week for the past two months."

      "text": "That sounds really distressing. How have these episodes affected your daily life and sleep?"

    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "It's ruining my life, honestly. I've stopped going out with friends because I'm terrified of having an attack in public. I called in sick to work four times last month. And I can't sleep. I lie in bed with my mind racing, and even when I do fall asleep, I wake up at 3 a.m. with my heart pounding. I'm getting maybe four hours of sleep a night. I'm exhausted."

      "speaker": "doctor",

    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "I've had some dark thoughts. Not like a plan or anything, but sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me, or I wish I could just disappear. Last week I thought about what it would be like if I just didn't wake up. But I wouldn't do anything. I have a younger sister who depends on me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "doctor",
      "text": "Thank you for being honest with me, that takes courage. I want to ask about a couple more things. Are you using anything to cope with the anxiety, like alcohol, marijuana, or any other substances? And have you noticed any physical changes like weight changes, feeling hot or cold, or tremors?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "I've been having a glass or two of wine to try to calm down at night, and honestly some nights it's more like a bottle. It's the only thing that helps me sleep. A friend also gave me some of her Xanax and I've been taking that a few times a week. I haven't told anyone about that. Physically, I have been losing weight without trying, I feel hot all the time, and my hands shake. I figured it was all just from the anxiety."

While not an immediate psychiatric emergency given the passive nature of ideation and protective factors, the combination of substance misuse, passive suicidal thoughts, and progressive functional decline necessitates timely psychiatric evaluation for proper diagnosis, safety planning, and pharmacological management. Thyroid function testing should also be ordered to rule out hyperthyroidism as a contributing or causative factor."

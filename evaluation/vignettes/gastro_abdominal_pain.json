    },
    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "It started about three weeks ago, but it's been getting worse. The pain is right here, under my ribs on the right side. It's a crampy, squeezing kind of pain that comes in waves, and it gets really bad after I eat, especially if I have anything greasy or fried."
    },

      "speaker": "doctor",
      "text": "How long do the episodes usually last, and does the pain travel anywhere else, like to your back or shoulder?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "Each episode lasts about 30 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer. The pain does go around to my right shoulder blade, which I thought was weird. Last night was the worst episode yet. I had pizza for dinner and within an hour I was doubled over in pain. I also felt really nauseous and threw up twice."

    {
      "speaker": "doctor",
      "text": "Have you noticed any fever, chills, changes in the color of your skin or eyes, or any changes in your stool or urine color?"

    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "I did feel feverish last night and this morning. I checked my temperature and it was 101.2. I haven't noticed my skin turning yellow, but my husband said my eyes looked a little yellow this morning. Now that you mention it, my urine has been darker than usual, like a tea color, for the past few days."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "doctor",
      "text": "That's helpful to know. Do you have any medical history I should be aware of? Any previous abdominal surgeries or similar episodes in the past?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "I had a similar but milder episode about six months ago that went away on its own, so I never followed up. I'm 45, I have high cholesterol, and I take birth control pills. I've had two pregnancies. My mother and sister both had their gallbladders removed. No surgeries on my end though."

The combination of pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's triad) raises concern for cholangitis in addition to acute cholecystitis. Urgent surgical and gastroenterology consultation is needed for right upper quadrant ultrasound, lab workup including liver function tests and CBC, and likely ERCP if choledocholithiasis is confirmed. Cholecystectomy will ultimately be required."

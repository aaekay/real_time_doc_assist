      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "It hit me like a bomb went off in my head. I was just sitting at my desk at work about three hours ago and suddenly I had the worst headache of my entire life. It came on in seconds, not gradually. I've never experienced anything like this."

    {
      "speaker": "doctor",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "It's a 10 out of 10, easily. I threw up twice on the way here. The light is bothering me terribly, and I feel like my neck is really stiff and sore. I can't bend my chin to my chest without it hurting badly."

      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "Yes, right before the headache I saw these weird flashing lights and then part of my vision went blurry on the right side. My left eyelid also seems to be drooping. I do get migraines sometimes, but this is nothing like my usual migraines. This is completely different and so much worse."

      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "No head trauma. I do have high blood pressure but I ran out of my amlodipine about two weeks ago and haven't refilled it. I'm not on blood thinners. My mother had a brain aneurysm when she was 50, which really scares me."

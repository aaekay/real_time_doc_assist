      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "It started as just a dry, nagging cough that I figured was from the weather or maybe allergies. But it hasn't gone away and it's gotten worse. Now it's more of a deep, rattling cough, and for the past two weeks, I've been coughing up stuff."

      "text": "At first it was just yellowish phlegm, but about a week ago I noticed streaks of blood in it. Then two days ago I coughed up about a tablespoon of bright red blood, and it really scared me. That's what made me come in. It's happened three times now."

      "text": "I've been smoking a pack a day for about 40 years. I know, I know, I should have quit a long time ago. I tried a few times but never stuck with it. I'm also having a hard time catching my breath doing simple things now, like walking to the mailbox. And my wife says I've been losing weight. I've dropped maybe 15 pounds in the last two months without trying."

My voice has gotten hoarser too. I worked in construction for 30 years, so I was probably around asbestos and all kinds of dust. No fevers that I've noticed though."

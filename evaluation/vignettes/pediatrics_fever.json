      "text": "Yes, doctor, I'm really worried. Her fever has been between 103 and 104.5 for five days straight. Tylenol brings it down a little but it always comes right back. And now she has this rash all over her trunk and arms that showed up yesterday."

      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "It's mostly red and blotchy, but I noticed a few spots on her legs that are dark red, almost purple, and they don't go away when I press them. She's barely eating anything and only taking small sips of water. She's had maybe two wet diapers today instead of her usual five or six."

      "speaker": "doctor",

      "text": "She's been really cranky and clingy, and today she's been sleeping a lot more than normal. She cries when I try to bend her head forward to put on her shirt. Her eyes also look red and puffy, and her lips are really dry and cracked. I also noticed her fingers seem a bit swollen."

And the last couple of days I've been feeling really nauseous and my stomach has been hurting. My breath also smells kind of weird, my girlfriend said it smells fruity."

Urgent endocrinology consultation is needed for immediate blood glucose and ketone assessment, initiation of insulin therapy, and determination of diabetes type through autoantibody testing and C-peptide levels. If DKA is confirmed, emergent management with IV fluids, insulin, and electrolyte monitoring is required."

      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "Hi, doctor. It started about two weeks ago. I get this heavy pressure right in the center of my chest whenever I walk up stairs or do anything physical. It feels like someone is sitting on my chest."

      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "Yes, actually, it goes down my left arm sometimes and I feel it in my jaw too. It usually lasts about five to ten minutes and goes away when I sit down and rest. But yesterday it lasted almost fifteen minutes and I was sweating pretty badly."

      "speaker": "patient",
      "text": "I take metformin for the diabetes, but I'll be honest, I haven't been great about checking my sugars. My dad had a heart attack at 58. I think my cholesterol was high last time they checked it, but I never started the medication for it. I also get short of breath going up just one flight of stairs now, which never used to happen."
